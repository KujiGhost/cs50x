# CS50x.Projects
Repository for all CS50x-related projects

This project was created using Scratch and simulates a record player, complete with start/pause button, rotating tone arm, and revolving platter/vinyl.

Once started, record will autoplay upon pressing PLAY, and auto-reset upon reaching the end of the track. The track can be paused and resumed mid-playthrough by pressing the PLAY button.

The track being played is 'Other Side' from the original Silent Hill on the PS1.
